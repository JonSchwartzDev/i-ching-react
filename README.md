# i-ching-react
The content for this React + Typescript SPA is the 3500-year-old taoist text, which offers nicely structured data, coolly binary logic from oh so long ago, and the opportunity for very nice-looking images that are small in size. It was bootstrapped from create-react-app, and contains 175 lines of TSX, 184 lines of CSS and about 1000 lines of content/data in Typescript. 

The app works well on phones, tablets and desktop, with great, snappy interactions because the data is small, and local in the SPA.

This version is deployed at https://iching-react.blackoak.io/ 

See https://github.com/JonSchwartzDev/i-ching-mithril for the Mithril SPA version.

See https://github.com/JonSchwartzDev/i-ching-aspmvc for the ASP NET Core MVC version.

Deploy size differences: Mithril 220kb, React webpack 800kb, ASP MVC 1200kb.
