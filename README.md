# i-ching-react
React SPA version of the I Ching.

See https://github.com/JonSchwartzDev/i-ching-mithril for the Mithril SPA version. That app is also live at http://iching.blackoak.io/. This React version has minor improvements in url routing for readability, but is otherwise the same functionality and design as the mithril version.

There's also an ASP NET Core MVC version at https://github.com/JonSchwartzDev/i-ching-aspmvc
