# i-ching-react
React SPA version of the I Ching.

It was bootstrapped from create-react-app, and contains 175 lines of TSX, 184 lines of CSS and about 1000 lines of content/data in Typescript.

See https://github.com/JonSchwartzDev/i-ching-mithril for the Mithril SPA version. That app is also live at http://iching.blackoak.io/. This React version has minor improvements in url routing for readability, but is otherwise the same functionality and design as the hosted mithril version.

There's also an ASP NET Core MVC version at https://github.com/JonSchwartzDev/i-ching-aspmvc
